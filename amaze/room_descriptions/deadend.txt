You stumble into wall. Your face hurts. You realize that you have reached a dead end and that there is no hope for you...

You turn the corner and see a wall. On the wall is a sign. The sign reads "You just reached a dead end. Sucks to be you."

You reach the end of the hallway and there is nowhere else to go. You turn around, only to be met by Prof. O. He tells you that this was all his doing and that you are now stuck here for the rest of your days!!

You fall down a hole in the floor... You died... THE END!!!

You reach the end of the hallway. All that is there to meet you is a wall... That's it... you're stuck now...

You are running down a hallway. All of a sudden, you trip! You turn around to see what you fell over and see an angry hoard of Trekkies. They tell you that you must proclaim your love of Star Trek or be thrown into the fiery pit of DOOM!!!              You pick the pit...

You crash into a wall. There is nowhere to turn. You are stuck

You have reached a dead end. I guess you are stuck here for the rest of your life since there is no way to go backwards due to a couple of programmers...

You turn the corner and are met with a dead end.

Great, your fantastic sense of direction has led you to a dead end. I guess you should have asked for directions after all...
